**phpweaver** is a tool for analysing parameter types in PHP code, using a combination of static and runtime analysis. It relies on the [xdebug extension](http://www.xdebug.org/docs/execution_trace) to trace function calls. The result of the analysis can then be used to generate docblock comments, with the proper type annotations.

Usage
---

The basic usage of phpweaver is to write a piece of code (If you have unit tests/examples, they would be a good candidate), that utilises the code to manipulate. Run this example with the tracer, then use weaver to generate docblocks from the trace.

See the `example/` folder for a basic example.

The project has two main commands:

* `trace`
* `weave`

`trace`
---

This is just a wrapper around php + xdebug. Use it in lieu of `php` to execute a php script. It will run normally, but the code is traced and the output is dumped in `dumpfile.xt`. You can also manually configure xdebug to generate the tracefile.

Sample usage:

    phpweaver trace test.php

If your script requires it's own paremeter you can stop paramerter pasing in bash with the double dash:

    phpweaver trace -- vendor/bin/phpunit "-c phpunit.xml"

`weave`
---

This command takes a dumpfile (Generated by the trace process) and a php-source path (directory or file), and injects docblock comments into the php-source, using the type-information from the trace. It will look for `dumpfile.xt` in the current directory, or a trace file specifyed using the --tracefile option, printing the modified file to stdout.

Sample usage:

    phpweaver weave somelibrary.php

The same dumpfile can be used to weave multiple files, by specifying a folder or multiple paths.

Running tests
---

There is a Dockerfile for getting an environment up and running. First install docker somehow, then issue:

    docker build -t phpweaver .
    docker run -it phpweaver

This will log you in to the machine. Run tests with:

    phpunit

For development, you will probably want to mount the repo into the container, so run it like this:

    docker run -it --mount type=bind,source="$(pwd)",target=/usr/src/app phpweaver

Any changes you make inside the container will now be reflected on your host system.
